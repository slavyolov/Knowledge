### üìùAssumptions of Linear Regression :

- Main :
	- Linearity of the data/model
	- No autocorrelation of residuals
	- mean of residuals is zero
	- Homoscedasticity (equal variance) of residuals
	- No (perfect) multicollinearity
	- The features and residuals are uncorrelated
	- The number of observations must be greater than number of features
	- There must be some variability in features
	
- These are verified on the fitted model (train data or whole dataset)

### Residuals

- The ‚Äúresiduals‚Äù in a time series model are what is left over after fitting a model. For many (but not all) time series models, the residuals are equal to the **difference between the observations and the corresponding fitted values**:  $$et=yt‚àí^yt.$$
- A good forecasting method will yield residuals with the following properties:

	1. The residuals are uncorrelated
	2. The residuals have zero mean. If the residuals have a mean other than zero, then the forecasts are biased.
			1. Adjusting for bias is easy: if the residuals have mean $\mu$, then simply add¬†$\mu$¬†to all forecasts and the bias problem is solved.
	3. The residuals have constant variance.
	4. The residuals are normally distributed.
