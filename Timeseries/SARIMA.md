```
Three years of **daily** electricity load data was gathered for a building on the UC Berkeley campus to create a model based on the buildingâ€™s electricity use from January 2016 through October 2019. The model will predict the daily loads for November 2019, and its effectiveness will be measured using mean absolute percentage error.
