# In brief

- **Prior beliefs** - Prior belief is _knowledge that one has about a parameter of interest before any events_ have been observed.

	- 
- Posterior
- Likelihood

- Bayesian approach
	- We update our prior beliefs with new information
	- Describes hypothesis and data in terms of probability distribution
