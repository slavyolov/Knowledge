## Lecture 1

- **Foundation models :**
	- BERT
	- GPT
	- LLaMa
	- FLAN-T5
	- BLOOM
	- PaLM

- LLMs take human written instructions and perform tasks
- The text that you pass to an LLM is known as a **prompt**
	- ```PROMPT : Which is the capital of Bulgaria?```
- The space or memory that is available to the prompt is called the ==**context window**== (typically a few 1000 words)
