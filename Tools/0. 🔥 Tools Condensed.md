# Python

## Unit-testing

### Pytest

- Official Documentation: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
- Changelog: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html).

## Linting

### Ruff

**Ruff** ensures the code adheres to style guidelines and detects issues like unused imports or inconsistent naming conventions.

- Official Documentation : https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/
- Releases : https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases

### Yamllint

**Yamllint** is a versatile linter tool specifically designed for YAML files. It checks for formatting discrepancies, key-value pair issues, and syntax errors, ensuring that YAML files are both syntactically correct and adhere to best practices.

- **Official Documentation**: [yamllint.readthedocs.io](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- **Changelog**: [GitHub Changelog](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst)
## Static-type-checking

### Mypy

**Mype** helps ensure that variables and functions are used correctly by checking type annotations in your code without running it. This is particularly useful in Python, which is dynamically typed, meaning type errors are typically only discovered at runtime.

-  Official Documentation: [Mypy Documentation on Read the Docs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Changelog: [Mypy Changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Code-coverage

Coverage tracks the execution of Python code, noting which lines have been executed and analyzing the source to determine which lines could have been executed but were not. This information is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of tests.
### Coverage

Coverage is a powerful tool for measuring code coverage in Python programs. It helps developers understand which parts of their code are executed during testing, thereby identifying untested or dead code.
 
- **Official Documentation**: [Coverage.py Documentation](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)
- **How It Works**: [How Coverage.py Works](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howitworks.html)
- **Installation Instructions**: [Installation Guide](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- **Command Line Usage**: [Command Line Documentation](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmd.html)
- **Change History**: [Release Notes](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html)

## IAC

### Pulumi

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. Pulumi is an open-source platform that enables developers and DevOps teams to manage infrastructure using popular programming languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and .NET languages. Unlike traditional IaC tools that use domain-specific languages (DSLs), Pulumi leverages general-purpose programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate infrastructure management into their existing workflows
