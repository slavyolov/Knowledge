# Python

## Unit-testing

### Pytest

- Official Documentation: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
- Changelog: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html).

## Linting

### Ruff

**Ruff** ensures the code adheres to style guidelines and detects issues like unused imports or inconsistent naming conventions.

- Official Documentation : https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/
- Releases : https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases

### Yamllint

**Yamllint** is a versatile linter tool specifically designed for YAML files. It checks for formatting discrepancies, key-value pair issues, and syntax errors, ensuring that YAML files are both syntactically correct and adhere to best practices.

- **Official Documentation**: [yamllint.readthedocs.io](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- **Changelog**: [GitHub Changelog](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst)
## Static-type-checking

### Mypy

**Mype** helps ensure that variables and functions are used correctly by checking type annotations in your code without running it. This is particularly useful in Python, which is dynamically typed, meaning type errors are typically only discovered at runtime.

-  Official Documentation: [Mypy Documentation on Read the Docs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Changelog: [Mypy Changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Code-coverage

Coverage tracks the execution of Python code, noting which lines have been executed and analyzing the source to determine which lines could have been executed but were not. This information is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of tests.
### Coverage

Coverage is a powerful tool for measuring code coverage in Python programs. It helps developers understand which parts of their code are executed during testing, thereby identifying untested or dead code.

## IAC

### Pulumi

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. Pulumi is an open-source platform that enables developers and DevOps teams to manage infrastructure using popular programming languages like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and .NET languages. Unlike traditional IaC tools that use domain-specific languages (DSLs), Pulumi leverages general-purpose programming languages, making it easier for developers to integrate infrastructure management into their existing workflows

# Databases

## Postgres

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

- Official documentation : https://www.postgresql.org/

### **Key features :** 
- reliability, robustness, and high performance
- highly concurrent database
### 1. **Advanced Indexing**

- PostgreSQL offers several indexing techniques, such as B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, BRIN, and GIN, allowing for efficient querying over large datasets. Custom indexes can be built to optimize specific queries.
- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html

### 2. **Concurrency Control**

- It uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent data access. This allows multiple users to interact with the database without locking each other out, enhancing read/write speeds and overall performance.
- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.1/mvcc.html

### 3. **Partitioning**

- Partitioning refers to splitting what is logically one large table into smaller physical pieces
- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html

### 4. **Parallel Query Execution**

- The database can execute queries in parallel across multiple CPU cores, significantly speeding up data processing and analysis
- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/how-parallel-query-works.html

### PostgreSQL and Asynchronous Programming in Python

Python’s asynchronous capabilities, enabled through libraries like `asyncio`, are well-matched with PostgreSQL's features for a number of reasons:

### 1. **Asynchronous Support**

- Libraries such as `asyncpg` are specifically designed for asynchronous operation with PostgreSQL. `asyncpg` is a Python library that provides a high-performance database interface specifically tailored for asyncio.
- https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg
### 2. **High Throughput**

- `asyncpg` is one of the fastest database drivers available for PostgreSQL and Python, capable of performing tens of thousands of database transactions per second per core, making full use of PostgreSQL's capabilities without blocking Python’s async loop.

### 3. **Scalability**

- Asynchronous programming combined with PostgreSQL’s inherent scalability features like connection pooling (via tools like `pgBouncer` or `asyncpg`'s pool) enables Python applications to handle large volumes of data and user connections efficiently.
- https://www.pgbouncer.org/
