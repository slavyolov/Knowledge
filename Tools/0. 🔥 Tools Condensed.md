# Python

## Unit-testing

### Pytest

- Official Documentation: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
- Changelog: [https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html).

## Linting

### Ruff

**Ruff** ensures the code adheres to style guidelines and detects issues like unused imports or inconsistent naming conventions.

- Official Documentation : https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/
- Releases : https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases

## Static-type-checking

### Mypy

**Mype** helps ensure that variables and functions are used correctly by checking type annotations in your code without running it. This is particularly useful in Python, which is dynamically typed, meaning type errors are typically only discovered at runtime.
