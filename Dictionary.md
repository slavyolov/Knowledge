- **[Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)**
	-  Heuristic is any approach to [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving") or [self-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-discovery "Self-discovery") that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be [optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimisation "Mathematical optimisation"), perfect, or [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation").
- **[Extrapolation](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorial/what-is-extrapolation)**
	- Extrapolation is the process of inferring values outside the range of the existing data to make predictions. Extrapolation is one of the essential methods that [data scientists](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-science-tutorial/how-to-become-a-data-scientist) use to predict future trends and outcomes.
	- Example : Observed demand at €7.5 and €10 (known range is (7.5, 10.0)).  Extrapolations is everything below 7.5 and above 10.0 .
- **exploration-exploitation trade-off**
	👉 **Exploration**: We want to explore the demand for a diverse enough range of price points so that we can accurately estimate our demand curve.

	👉 **Exploitation**: We want to exploit all the knowledge we have gained through exploring and actually do what we set out to do: set our price at an optimal level.
- #contextual_bandits problem, **a learner repeatedly observes a context, chooses an action, and observes a loss/cost/reward for the chosen action only**. Contextual bandit algorithms use additional side information (or context) to aid real world decision-making
- **Frictionless shopping** 
	- The idea of connecting buyers and sellers in a way that provides consumers the ability to instantly find the products or services they need.
	- Examples :  one-click pay buttons online and contactless payments in the store.

		- The prior is sometimes described as the “belief” about the data. This means that we choose the prior according to our knowledge of the data.

- [Logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function)
	- A **logistic function** or **logistic curve** is a common S-shaped curve ([sigmoid curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function "Sigmoid function")) with the equation
- **µ - population mean**
- **[Gaussian Distribution and Gaussian Noise](https://samanemami.medium.com/the-role-of-the-gaussian-distribution-in-machine-learning-5b1c04f87967)**
	- Adding Gaussian noise to data involves introducing random variations following a Gaussian or normal distribution. The process involves generating random numbers from a Gaussian distribution and adding them to the original data points. **The mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution determine the characteristics of the added noise**. The mean of the Gaussian noise determines the shift or offset applied to the data, while the standard deviation controls the spread or magnitude of the noise.

- [Variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp)
	- Variance is a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. It measures how far each number in the set is from the [mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp) (average), and thus from every other number in the set
	- Tags : #variance
- [Standard Deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp)
	- The [square root of the variance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021215/what-difference-between-standard-deviation-and-variance.asp) is the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) (SD or σ)
	- Standard deviation measures how much the values in a dataset deviate or vary from the average (mean) of that dataset. It measures the spread or dispersion of the data points
	- **Low standard deviation** - datapoints are close to the mean. Indicating less variability
	- **High standard deviation** - datapoints are more spread out from the mean. Showing higher variability

- [Covariance](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-calculate-covariance)
	- Covariance is a measurement used in statistics to determine if two variables are changing in the same direction. 
	- It is a measurement of the difference between the two variables, **and the two variables used to determine covariance are unrelated**.

- [Covariance Matrix](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/covariance-matrix/)
	- Covariance matrix is a [square matrix](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/square-matrix/) that displays the **variance** exhibited by elements of datasets and the **covariance** between a pair of datasets.
	- Variance of two datasets A = {3, 2} and B = {7, 4} is for A = 0.25 and for B = 2.25 (*using var.p)
	- Covariance of the two datasets is 0.75
	- The covariance matrix is :
	- $$ \begin{array}{cc} 0.25 &0.75 \\ 0.75 & 2.25 \end{array} $$
	- Variance covariance matrix is defined as a square [matrix](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/solve-matrices/) where the diagonal elements represent the [variance](https://www.cuemath.com/data/variance/) and the off-diagonal elements represent the covariance. The covariance between two variables can be positive, negative, and zero. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables have a positive relationship whereas negative covariance shows that they have a negative relationship. If two elements do not vary together then they will display a zero covariance.

- Feature matrix
	- Feature matrix is typically a 2D array (matrix) with shape (n_samples, n_features)
		- n_samples - number of data points (rows in the dataset)
		- n_features - number of independent variables or covariates (columns in the matrix)
	- The first column often contains all 1s (this is called the **intercept** or **bias term**)
	- The following columns represent the features that may influence the target (e.g **covariates**)
