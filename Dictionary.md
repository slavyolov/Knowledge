- **[Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)**
	-  Heuristic is any approach to [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving") or [self-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-discovery "Self-discovery") that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be [optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimisation "Mathematical optimisation"), perfect, or [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation").
- **[Extrapolation](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorial/what-is-extrapolation)**
	- Extrapolation is the process of inferring values outside the range of the existing data to make predictions. Extrapolation is one of the essential methods that [data scientists](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-science-tutorial/how-to-become-a-data-scientist) use to predict future trends and outcomes.
	- Example : Observed demand at €7.5 and €10 (known range is (7.5, 10.0)).  Extrapolations is everything below 7.5 and above 10.0 .
- **exploration-exploitation trade-off**
	👉 **Exploration**: We want to explore the demand for a diverse enough range of price points so that we can accurately estimate our demand curve.

	👉 **Exploitation**: We want to exploit all the knowledge we have gained through exploring and actually do what we set out to do: set our price at an optimal level.
- #contextual_bandits problem, **a learner repeatedly observes a context, chooses an action, and observes a loss/cost/reward for the chosen action only**. Contextual bandit algorithms use additional side information (or context) to aid real world decision-making
- **Frictionless shopping** 
	- The idea of connecting buyers and sellers in a way that provides consumers the ability to instantly find the products or services they need.
	- Examples :  one-click pay buttons online and contactless payments in the store.

	- Prior distribution 
		- The prior is sometimes described as the “belief” about the data. This means that we choose the prior according to our knowledge of the data.

- [Logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function)
	- A **logistic function** or **logistic curve** is a common S-shaped curve ([sigmoid curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function "Sigmoid function")) with the equation

- **[Gaussian Distribution and Gaussian Noise](https://samanemami.medium.com/the-role-of-the-gaussian-distribution-in-machine-learning-5b1c04f87967)**
	- Adding Gaussian noise to data involves introducing random variations following a Gaussian or normal distribution. The process involves generating random numbers from a Gaussian distribution and adding them to the original data points. **The mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution determine the characteristics of the added noise**. The mean of the Gaussian noise determines the shift or offset applied to the data, while the standard deviation controls the spread or magnitude of the noise.
