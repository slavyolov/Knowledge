- **[Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)**
	-  Heuristic is any approach to [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving") or [self-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-discovery "Self-discovery") that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be [optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimisation "Mathematical optimisation"), perfect, or [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation").
- **[Extrapolation](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorial/what-is-extrapolation)**
	- Extrapolation is the process of inferring values outside the range of the existing data to make predictions. Extrapolation is one of the essential methods that [data scientists](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-science-tutorial/how-to-become-a-data-scientist) use to predict future trends and outcomes.
	- Example : Observed demand at €7.5 and €10 (known range is (7.5, 10.0)).  Extrapolations is everything below 7.5 and above 10.0 .
- **exploration-exploitation trade-off**
	👉 **Exploration**: We want to explore the demand for a diverse enough range of price points so that we can accurately estimate our demand curve.

	👉 **Exploitation**: We want to exploit all the knowledge we have gained through exploring and actually do what we set out to do: set our price at an optimal level.
- #contextual_bandits problem, **a learner repeatedly observes a context, chooses an action, and observes a loss/cost/reward for the chosen action only**. Contextual bandit algorithms use additional side information (or context) to aid real world decision-making
- **Frictionless shopping** 
	- The idea of connecting buyers and sellers in a way that provides consumers the ability to instantly find the products or services they need.
	- Examples :  one-click pay buttons online and contactless payments in the store.

	- A **logistic function** or **logistic curve** is a common S-shaped curve ([sigmoid curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function "Sigmoid function")) with the equation
- **µ - population mean**
- **[Gaussian Distribution and Gaussian Noise](https://samanemami.medium.com/the-role-of-the-gaussian-distribution-in-machine-learning-5b1c04f87967)**
	- Adding Gaussian noise to data involves introducing random variations following a Gaussian or normal distribution. The process involves generating random numbers from a Gaussian distribution and adding them to the original data points. **The mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution determine the characteristics of the added noise**. The mean of the Gaussian noise determines the shift or offset applied to the data, while the standard deviation controls the spread or magnitude of the noise.

- [Variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp)
	- Variance is a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. It measures how far each number in the set is from the [mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp) (average), and thus from every other number in the set
	- Tags : #variance
- [Standard Deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp)
	- The [square root of the variance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021215/what-difference-between-standard-deviation-and-variance.asp) is the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) (SD or σ)
	- Standard deviation measures how much the values in a dataset deviate or vary from the average (mean) of that dataset. It measures the spread or dispersion of the data points
	- **Low standard deviation** - datapoints are close to the mean. Indicating less variability
	- **High standard deviation** - datapoints are more spread out from the mean. Showing higher variability

- [Covariance](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-calculate-covariance)
	- Covariance is a measurement used in statistics to determine if two variables are changing in the same direction. 
	- It is a measurement of the difference between the two variables, **and the two variables used to determine covariance are unrelated**.

- [Covariance Matrix](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/covariance-matrix/)
	- Covariance matrix is a [square matrix](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/square-matrix/) that displays the **variance** exhibited by elements of datasets and the **covariance** between a pair of datasets.
	- Variance of two datasets A = {3, 2} and B = {7, 4} is for A = 0.25 and for B = 2.25 (*using var.p)
	- Covariance of the two datasets is 0.75
	- The covariance matrix is :
	- $$ \begin{array}{cc} 0.25 &0.75 \\ 0.75 & 2.25 \end{array} $$
	- Variance covariance matrix is defined as a square [matrix](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/solve-matrices/) where the diagonal elements represent the [variance](https://www.cuemath.com/data/variance/) and the off-diagonal elements represent the covariance. The covariance between two variables can be positive, negative, and zero. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables have a positive relationship whereas negative covariance shows that they have a negative relationship. If two elements do not vary together then they will display a zero covariance.

- Feature matrix
	- Feature matrix is typically a 2D array (matrix) with shape (n_samples, n_features)
		- n_samples - number of data points (rows in the dataset)
		- n_features - number of independent variables or covariates (columns in the matrix)
	- The first column often contains all 1s (this is called the **intercept** or **bias term**)
	- The following columns represent the features that may influence the target (e.g **covariates**)
	- Tags : #feature_matrix, #intercept, #bias_term
- Intercept
- Bias term
- Multivariate Normal Distribution
	- Generalizes the univariate normal distribution to multiple dimensions, where each dimension represents a different variable (or feature). 
	- Instead of having a single mean and variance, the multivariate normal distribution has a **mean vector** and a **covariance matrix**
	- In bayesian statistics :
		- mean vector (mu) - prior belief of the expected value of the beta coefficient for each variable (For example, if we have three variables **mu** could be defined as [1, 1, 1]. Which means that before seeng the data we expect the mean value of our variables to be equal to 1)
- Stratum / strata (pl) 
	- In statistics, a stratum (plural strata) refers to **a subset (part) of the population (entire collection of items under consideration) which is being sampled**. Stratification thus consists of dividing the population into strata within each of which an independent sample can be chosen.


- ======Web Development======
	- **HTTP** 
		- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview
		- **HTTP** (Hyper Text Transfer protoccol) is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
		
		- **Clients** and **servers** communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). 
		- **Client** sends **requests**
		- The messages send by the **server** as an answer are called **_responses_**.
		- We can use the HTTP protocol to transfer data. The most popular technology for this purpose is JSON
		- Tags: #http, #web_development
	- **TCP**
		- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP
		- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is an important network [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) that lets two hosts connect and exchange data streams. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and packets in the same order as they were sent.
		- Tags: #tcp, #web_development 
	- **TLS / SSL**
		- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS
		- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, formerly known as [Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSL), is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol) used by applications to communicate securely across a network, preventing tampering with and eavesdropping on email, web browsing, messaging, and other protocols. individual digital certificates.
		- Tags: #tls, #ssl
	- **Client**
		- The _user-agent_ is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser
		- The browser is **always** the entity initiating the request.
		- To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the page.  It then parses this file, making additional requests corresponding to execution scripts, layout information (CSS) to display, and sub-resources contained within the page (usually images and videos). The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page
		- A Web page is a hypertext document. This means some parts of the displayed content are links, which can be activated (usually by a click of the mouse) to fetch a new Web page, allowing the user to direct their user-agent and navigate through the Web. The browser translates these directions into HTTP requests, and further interprets the HTTP responses to present the user with a clear response.
	- **Server**
		- On the opposite side of the communication channel is the server, which _serves_ the document as requested by the client. A server appears as only a single machine virtually; but it may actually be a collection of servers sharing the load (load balancing), or other software (such as caches, a database server, or e-commerce servers)
	- **OSI model and the HTTP protocol**
		- There are seven layers, each of them performs the task independently
		- https://arshadsuraj.medium.com/overview-osi-model-http-protocol-5173684f2491
	- **WSGI**
		- Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a simple [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention "Calling convention") for [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") to forward requests to [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application") or [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework "Web framework") written in the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)")

	- **ASGI**
		- So, after the **asyncio** API became popular, the **ASGI specification** emerged as an alternative of WSGI, that leverages the new API as much as possible. We see now a new generation of **base and application development servers:**
			- As base server, we use [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
			- For application development, we use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
	- **REST API**
		- The REST API pattern was developed to build large enterprise software as a service, and it defines some standards on how to make an easy to consume API over the HTTP protocol.
		- A REST API follows the design principles of the REST architectural style. **REST is short for representational state transfer**, and is a set of rules and guidelines about how you should build a web API.
		- https://blog.stoplight.io/api-design-patterns-for-rest-web-services
	- **HTTP Methods**
		- **GET**: read data from your API
		- **POST**: add _new data_ to your API
		- **PUT**: update _existing data_ with your API
		- **PATCH**: updates a _subset of existing data_ with your API
		- **DELETE**: remove data (usually a single resource) from your API
	- **Fast API**
		- Web framework for ASGI application development
		- **FastAPI depends heavily on Pydantic.** Meaning all the Request and Response payload serialization/desserialization is handled by defining Pydantic model classes
	- **CORSMiddleware**
		- CORSMiddleware is a component in web frameworks like FastAPI that enables and configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for web applications. CORSMiddleware allows you to configure how your web API handles cross-origin requests from browsers. It implements the CORS protocol, which permits controlled access to resources on a different domain than the one serving the web page.

		- *Tips :* 
			- Avoid using `allow_origins=["*"]` in production, as it allows any origin
			- Only allow specific origins, methods, and headers needed by your application
			- Be cautious when allowing credentials, as it can increase security risks

	- **Shadow deployment**
		- is a [software deployment practice](https://codefresh.io/learn/software-deployment/) where any changes to a software application are deployed in a parallel environment that mimics the production environment. The deployed changes are not visible to the end-users, hence the term “shadow.” This hidden deployment enables us to observe the behavior and impact of the changes without causing any disruption to the live application.
