- **[Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic)**
	- Â Heuristic is any approach toÂ [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving")Â orÂ [self-discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-discovery "Self-discovery")Â that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to beÂ [optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimisation "Mathematical optimisation"), perfect, orÂ [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal orÂ [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation "Approximation").
- **[Extrapolation](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorial/what-is-extrapolation)**
	- Extrapolation is the process of inferring values outside the range of the existing data to make predictions. Extrapolation is one of the essential methods thatÂ [data scientists](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-science-tutorial/how-to-become-a-data-scientist)Â use to predict future trends and outcomes.
	- Example : Observed demand at â‚¬7.5 and â‚¬10 (known range is (7.5, 10.0)).  Extrapolations is everything below 7.5 and above 10.0 .
- **exploration-exploitation trade-off**
	ðŸ‘‰Â **Exploration**: We want to explore the demand for a diverse enough range of price points so that we can accurately estimate our demand curve.

	ðŸ‘‰Â **Exploitation**: We want to exploit all the knowledge we have gained through exploring and actually do what we set out to do: set our price at an optimal level.
