The generalized linear model (GLM) generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.

# Tips : 

- y is coming from any exponential family distribution
- Some function of the mean is related to the linear predictor
- How beta coefficients are found : through maximum likelihood method
